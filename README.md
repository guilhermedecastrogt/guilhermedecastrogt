## About me

I’m a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** with a strong **ownership mindset**, experienced in building **production-grade, scalable systems** used in real business environments.

I work primarily with **TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, and MySQL**, and also have solid backend experience within the **.NET ecosystem**. I’ve owned features and systems end-to-end — from requirements and architecture to implementation, **CI/CD**, deployments, monitoring, and long-term maintenance.

I care deeply about delivering software that is **reliable**, **observable**, and **built to last**. I thrive in fast-paced, high-responsibility environments, working closely with product and business stakeholders to turn complex problems into simple, effective solutions.

---

## What I build

- **Automation projects** that reduce manual work and improve operational efficiency  
- **AI-powered tools** and internal platforms  
- **SaaS products** with scalability, observability, and maintainability in mind  
- **E-commerce systems** focusing on performance, reliability, and integrations
