# Hello, I'm Guilherme ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal GitHub homepage! This repository serves as a hub for showcasing my projects, skills, and interests. Feel free to explore and get to know more about me.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building web applications fast, smooth, modern and easy to use. I work with technologies like Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, .NET, Typescript, Docker, CI/CD to create AI-powered tools, automation projects, and SaaS products. Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve worked with clients from my country, helping them turn ideas into real, working solutions. I enjoy solving problems, making things more efficient, and creating products that not only work well but also feel great to use.
## Projects

- [Whatsapp Bulk Sender](https://github.com/guilhermedecastrogt/whatsapp-bulk-sender): Itâ€™s a modern web application with a dark-themed frontend (built with React + TypeScript) and a backend powered by FastAPI + Python. It enables you to send messages via WhatsApp to multiple phone numbers by either pasting them manually or uploading a CSV/Excel file. .
